# Learning Go

Alright, i'd consider myself an intermediate Go programmer at this point, but I'd like to get a bit better. 
So I've picked up this book. Its called "Learning Go" by Jon Bodner. 

I'll be honest, this thing is a fucking wedge of a thing. You could probs use it to bludgeon somebody to death.

These are purely personal notes, so expect things to be broken, swearing and general faffery.

Let's see how far I get.
